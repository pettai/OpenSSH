OpenSSH, version 5.6p1
for Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard), universal (Intel and PPC) and
for Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), universal (32-bit and 64-bit)

This OpenSSH provides recompiled ssh applications to work with smart cards. 
Native OpenSSH (5.2p1) didn't support smart cards. 

To compile it, just grab this git repository, then just a 'OSX_RELEASE="10.5" make' or 'OSX_RELEASE="10.6" make'
on a MacOSX 10.6 with the last XCode.

All executables will be installed in /Library/OpenSC/bin/ and are prepended with a 'sc' (ssh -> scssh),
so there is no conflict with the native executables installed with MacOSX. You can also add 
/Library/OpenSC/bin to your $PATH without conflict.

To test and to use:
/Library/OpenSC/bin/pkcs15-tool --read-ssh-key your_id
Paste the relevant line to the authorized_keys file on the remote system
/Library/OpenSC/bin/scssh -I /Librart/OpenSC/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so login@remote.org
